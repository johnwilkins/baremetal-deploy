= Configuring managed Secure Boot in the `install-config.yaml` file (optional)

To enable managed Secure Boot, add the `bootMode` configuration setting to each node.

[source,yaml]
.Example
----
hosts:
  - name: openshift-master-0
    role: master
    bmc:
      address: ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>
      username: <user>
      password: <password>
    bootMACAddress: <NIC1-mac-address>
    rootDeviceHints:
     deviceName: "/dev/sda"
    bootMode: UEFISecureBoot <1>
----

<1> The `bootMode` setting is `legacy` by default. Change it to `UEFISecureBoot` to enable managed Secure Boot.

[NOTE]
====
See xref:configuring-nodes_ipi-install-prerequisites[Configuring nodes for Secure Boot manually] for additional details. to ensure the nodes can support managed Secure Boot. If not, you can xref:configuring-nodes-for-secure-boot_ipi-install-prerequisites[enable Secure Boot manually], which requires Redfish virtual media.
